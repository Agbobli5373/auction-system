### Online Auction System
<hr>

An e-commerce website where people would go to sell or buy stuff but an online auction is a process of buying and selling goods and different kinds of things where products donâ€™t have a clear price. 

So the interested buyers would offer a bid. A bid is an offer of a certain price that someone is willing to pay for a particular product in the auction. Offering a bid and taking the highest bid. And then selling the particular item to the highest qualified bidder.

Itâ€™s a place that holds auctions on the internet. It's a platform that is a mediator for two kinds of people. The seller and the buyer or the bidder. The seller is someone who creates a listing for placing their product in the auction according to his needs. And the buyer is someone who sees items they are interested in, they can bid for that item. And the highest bid wins that particular item listed in the auction.
